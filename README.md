# ** Referee Mod for Thrill of the Fight **

## Description
Have you ever looked at the referee and in your head you went...
> I really really want to fucking beat the crap out of that guy.

Or maybe you have thought...
> Bla bla i am referee i say "Back up gentlemen" and no one likes me

Well... me too and whilst i know that every thrill of the fight player out there has smacked the referee around quite a bit that is not enough right. He deserves more then just a little smack every now and then.

That is why i created this mod. So turns out, the referee does not really like it that much when you hit him either. So i asked him if he would agree to a matchup between the player and him. And he agreed...

## Information
This mod is developed using the BepInEx mod loader for Unity, BepInEx version 5.4.21 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21 "here"), and BepInEx download instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Jacklog8/RefMod_Totf#bepinex-installation "here"). This mod loader is not my product and i am not affiliated with the BepInEx team.
